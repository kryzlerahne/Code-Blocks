**Code Blocks: Basics of Python**

**_Introduction:_**

Programming, without a doubt, is very important most specially to students that takes up courses in line with Information Technology and Computer Science. Not only with these programs, but also with some such as for Engineering students because they use this for harnessing the power of computing and creating intelligent machines and devices. This is one of the stepping stones of the students to develop their ability to improve their way of thinking and analyzing data and information correctly. One of todayâ€™s most popular and in demand programming language that is easy to use and on the go is Python. This also lets us to integrate systems and programs more effectively compared to other languages. 

**_Functions:_**

So, this program was created to learn the basics of Python in one of the most exciting, fun and interactive way through a game that incorporates 5 different levels. This is a desktop application that contains some pictures for visual effects, sounds, animation and pygame content. Here, I would like to integrate and utilize the pygame library. The goal on each level is to reach the end and finish the track without being touched by some objects along the path. The interaction graphics to be used are straightforward to avoid complications to users by just simply using the spacebar to jump whenever something blocks the way of the player. Every after a level is surpassed and completed, short lessons and trivias would appear on screen to enhance the knowledge of the user about programming using Python. And after reaching and finishing all these 5 levels, a very short quiz will be conducted to recall and apply everything that you have learned throughout the game.

**_Objectives:_**

Simply, the goal and objective of this program is for the users to enjoy and be entertained while learning and acquiring new knowledge.
The basic learning of Python will include the following: its basic concept, strings and variables, control structures and some functions and modules.
